This is the second weather application that I built with the Gainesville Dev Academy.

There were three things I focused on achieving in this project:

1. Successfully utilize AngularJS throughout my code.

2. Utilize geo location to make user experience better.

3. Filter data and post the top 3 choices in a vague search.
    ex. When "Gainesville" is searched and no state was given, my code displays the top 3 choices.
